# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.

Prior to any analysis and segmentation, data is preprocessed as per the demands. Major problem in this dataset was the existence of outliers.

We have tried different clustering techniques to create discrete customer groups like KMeans clustering, Birch clustering, and Hierarchical clustering.
